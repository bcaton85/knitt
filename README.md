# Kubernetes Native Integration Test Tool

## Description

A tool used to automated integration tests of services in kubernetes namespaces.
Offers reliability in that tests are ran against services in a more production like environment.

Short explanation:

A test pod is deployed into the target namespace containing the user made test scripts, those scripts are ran and the logs are sent to stdout. The test resources are then removed.

A detailed workflow:

- The given pod template is applied to the target namespace
- The pod is checked to be in the Ready state before continuing
- The test project or scripts are copied from the local machine to the remote pod
- The tests are ran with the given entrypoint and logs are streamed back to standard out
- The exit status is checked, if set to silent a non-zero exit code from the entrypoint will not cause the command to fail
- If a timeout value is given the command will pause for the specified amount of time
- After the timeout the pod resource deleted
