Run the tests against a kubernetes service. A test pod is deployed into the target namespace which will run the test scripts given.
A detailed workflow:
	- The given pod template is applied to the target namespace
	- The pod is checked to be in the Ready state before continuing
	- The test project or scripts are copied from the local machine to the remote pod
	- The tests are ran with the given entrypoint and logs are streamed back to standard out
	- The exit status is checked, if set to silent a non-zero exit code from the entrypoint will not cause the command to fail
	- If a timeout value is given the command will pause for the specified amount of time
	- After the timeout the pod resource deleted
